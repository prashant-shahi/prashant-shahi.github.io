## About

Hey there! I am Prashant.

![Prashant's Photo](/images/website.jpg)

I hail from Himalayas of Nepal who grew up playing alongside Yeti,
the mythical beast. ;)

I recall the start of my love and passion for coding since mid-2000 when
I first got introduced to QBasic. At present, I am working in DevOps but
I am passionate about various engineering domains, product, and
developer relations. I can wear different hats as needed.

In my spare time, I relish to go out for trekking, listen to acoustic music, play the guitar, and
contribute to Wikipedia.
