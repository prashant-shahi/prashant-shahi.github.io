## About

Hey there! I am Prashant.

![Prashant's Photo](/images/website.jpg)

I hail from Himalayas of Nepal who grew up playing alongside Yeti,
the mythical beast.

I recall the start of my love and passion for coding since mid-2000 when
I first got introduced to QBasic. At present, I am passionate about various engineering domains,
product, and developer relations. I can wear different hats as needed.

In my spare time, I relish to go out for trekking, listen to acoustic music, play the guitar, and
[contribute to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:coolboi567).

## Work

Currently, I am working as a Developer Advocate Engineer at [Dgraph Labs](https://dgraph.io/).
Dgraph is an open-source graph database written entirely in [Go](https://golang.org/). It is also
the only database that natively supports GraphQL. It was my love for FOSS brings him to Dgraph.

In the past, I have worked for [Rapido Bike Taxi](http://rapido.bike/), where I
majorly contributed to their DevOps infrastructure. Before that, I have also worked
remotely for [Noodles Factory](https://www.noodlefactory.ai/) and contributed in
building the backend from ground up.
